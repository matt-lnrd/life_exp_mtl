# Abstract

Here we will examine the relationship between time and maximum life expectancey as observed by Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

#Analysis

After some analysis we reached the same conclusion.

Loads data
```{r}
library(gapminder)
data("gapminder_unfiltered")
gapminder_unfiltered
```

plot
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(gapminder_unfiltered,aes(year, lifeExp,color=continent))+ 
         geom_point()
```

Calculate maximum

```{r}
gapminder_unfiltered %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>% 
  ungroup() ->
  maxdf
```
